            <h1>TELLME</h1>
            <p>
                The project on which our team decided to work was related to new technology, by using which strangers can leave a message to a homeowner. We designed a device called TELLME that can receive messages via bluetooth (Bluetooth Low Energy) and save the given information for the target person. We also included a mail sending feature in our application by using which homeowner can receive new messages in real time. Also, for identification purposes we included a camera module in our device, from which a stranger image will be captured and sent via email with the text message. Our team’s main goal was to change the current situation - where strangers were leaving plain papers at the door, which was not the safest option for transferring information person to person. So by using our device, people can leave messages confidentially, even when they do not have the target person’s contact information at hand.

                    From TELLME, homeowners can receive mails directly in real time for which they only need to include their email address and set up internet connection by writing an internet name and password. Internet connection problems will not prevent TELLME from receiving and saving incoming messages; the only difference will be that the target person will be able to see the new messages after returning at home.
